    <h1>My Website</h1>

    <article>
        <h1>Article Name</h1>
        <h2>This is an article about article names !!</h2>
        <p>This is a fake article for the purpose of styling. I like making fake articles because I get to type whatever and in the end it really doesn't matter.</p>
        <p>What does this article mean to you? Likely very little. I hope one day I can make website with articles that are so important to others. </p>
