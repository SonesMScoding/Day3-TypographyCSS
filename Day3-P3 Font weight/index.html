        <h1>Thin Weight</h1>
        <p>Usage: Often used for minimalist designs, creating a delicate or sophisticated aesthetic.

        </p><p>  Mood: Light, airy, minimalistic, modern.</p>
    </span>
    <span class="light">
        <h1>Light Weight</h1>
        <p>Usage: Light font weights are also great for minimal or clean designs, where subtlety and elegance are key.

    </span>
    <span class="bolder">
